**.DCU Software Plan Architecture.**

**Components to control:**
	Door Proximity
	Door Prediction
	Door Position Detection (open/close/in-motion)
	Hindrance Obstacle Detector
	Door Status Mag Lock (Locked/Unlocked)
	Audible Bell Speaker
	Visual Lights
	Motor 
	Button Activation
	Emergency Release Mechanism

	Safety interlock

**Establish Input and Output Pins**
**Input Pins:**
	Door Proximity Sensor (Input)
        	//Detects if the platform is close to the train.
	Door Position Detection Limit Switch Open (Input)
		//Provides the current status of the door: open, closed, or in motion.
	Door Position Detection Limit Switch Close (Input)
		//Provides the current status of the door: open, closed, or in motion.
	Hindrance Obstacle Detector (Input)
		//Detects obstacles in the doorâ€™s path.
	Emergency Release Mechanism (Input)
		//Signals an emergency release situation requiring the doors to be opened manually.

	//possible pins for talking to raspberry pi for interface

// Output Pin Definitions
#define motorCWSpin
#define motorACWSpin
#define magLockClose
#define magLockOpen
#define audibleSpeaker
#define doorStatusLightR
#define doorStatusLightG
#define doorStatusLightY
#define systemStatusLED


**Output Pins:**
	Motor Control Clockwise (Output)
		//Controls the movement of the doors (open).
	Motor Control Anti-Clockwise (Output)
		//Controls the movement of the doors (close).
	Door Status Magnetic Lock Close (Output)
		//Controls the locking mechanism to secure the doors.
	Door Status Magnetic Lock Open (Output)
		//Controls the locking mechanism to secure the doors.
	Audible Bell Speaker (Output)
		//Emits a sound to indicate door movement or an alert.
	Visual Lights Red (Output)
		//Indicates the door status (red for locked).
	Visual Lights Greem (Output)
		//Indicates the door status (green for unlocked).
	Visual Lights Amber (Output)
		//Indicates the door status (amber for obstacle in way).
	System Status Lights
		//flashing lights within controller system to know that everything is working, if light stops flashing then you know something is not working

**Logic:**
	Door Prediction System Function
  		//variable receiving data from the overall train control system, indicating when a train is approaching.
  		//Signals when the train is approaching the platform.

	Safety Interlock
  		//ensures all conditions are safe for the doors to operate 


		//if
  			//do
	 
	Train Approaching (Prediction System & Proximity Sensor)
		//When the Door Prediction system signals that a train is approaching
  		//And the Door Proximity Sensor detects the train is close enough
			//Activate the Visual Lights to signal that the doors are about to open.
		//If the Safety Interlock is confirmed 
  		//And no obstacles are detected by the Hindrance Obstacle Detector
  			// Unlock the doors by deactivating the Door Status Magnetic Lock.
        
	Door Opening Sequence
        	//If the doors are unlocked
			//Activate the Motor Control to open the doors.
   			//Activate Visual light to green colour flashing for opening
	  		//Activate Audible Bell for door opening
        	//Monitor the Door Position Detection to track the door's status during the opening.
			//Output to console the status
        	//If any obstacle is detected by the Hindrance Obstacle Detector
			//Stop the motor 
   			//Trigger the Audible Bell Speaker to alert.
	  		//Activate Visual light to warning colour (orange?)
	 		//Continue closing after the obstacle removed
        	//If the door fully opens without hindrance
			//Signal the system to maintain the open position.
   			//Visual light colour green steady on
        
	Door Closing Sequence
        	//Once the Safety Interlock releases
		//And no obstacles are detected
  			//Activate the Motor Control to close the doors.
	 		//Activate visual light to red flashing.
			//Activate audible bell for door closing
        	//Continuously monitor the Door Position Detection during closure.
			//Output to console the status
        	//If an obstacle is detected during the closing
			//Stop the motor
   			//Trigger the Audible Bell Speaker to alert.
	  		//Activate Visual light to warning colour (orange?)
   			//Keep the doors open until the obstacle is cleared and continue closing
        	//Once fully closed
			//activate the Door Status Magnetic Lock to secure the doors.

	Emergency Situations
        	//If the Emergency Release Mechanism is triggered
			//Immediately unlock the doors releasing the maglock
   			//Open them using the Motor Control or manually pull them open
	  		//Activate Audible Bell
	 		//Activate Visual red flashing light

	Total Door Operation
        	//function to controll the other functions and be called in the main loop?
			//If the doors are closed
				//Follow the opening sequence
			//If the doors are open
				//Follow the closing sequence
